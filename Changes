0.10 2010/09/29
  - no code changes
  - added Try::Tiny dependency, hoping to catch test errors correctly

0.09 2010/09/23

    writing a set of independent scripts to writing one dispatcher
    script.

    looks for subcommands.

  - Now you can add a "check" method to a command to see if it is
    really available for a user (if the command dies there due to
    the lack of recommended modules etc, the dying message will be
    shown in the commands list). (rjbs++)

0.04 2009/07/10
  - should always parse .pod file if it exists (tokuhirom++)
